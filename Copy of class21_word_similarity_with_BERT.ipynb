Word Similarity with BERT\n","\n","*This notebook draws upon materials created by the [The BERT for Humanists](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists/) Team*\n","\n","In Lucy Li's [paper about language variation across Reddit communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06820), she used two methods for determining the community-specific meanings of certain words: comparing the similarity of their BERT embeddings within commmunities, and comparing their potential BERT-dervied substitutes within communities. In the case of the former, the underlying method is a measure of cosine similarity, which is what this notebook will explore, using a collection of 16th-20th century English language poems. \n","\n","## Data and model\n","Our poems were scraped from [Public-Domain-Poetry.com](http://public-domain-poetry.com/) by Melanie Walsh. As for our model, we'll be using the [DistilBert model](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html) via the HuggingFace Python library. DistilBert is a smaller — yet still powerful! — version of BERT. By using the rich representations of words that BERT produces, we will then explore the multivalent meanings of particular words in context and over time.\n","\n","## Overview: Word similarity\n","Just as Lucy asked whether r/Fitness and r/CasualUK used the word \"lift\" in different ways, we can ask whether 16th-century and 20th-century poets use the word \"science\" in different ways. Or the word \"nature.\" Or the word \"machine.\" We'll use cosine similiarity to compare each embedding, since these embeddings are, in fact, vectors! If you recall, we've used this same calculation of cosine similarity to compare TF/IDF representations of documents as well as  word2vec-derived vectors of words in a corpus.\n","\n","Since the majority of the code below is setup--that is, loading the poetry dataset, encoding it for use with BERT, and downloading the pretrained DistilBert model, it might help to see a preview of where we're heading:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zsAaAlwhZsKr","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":605},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668714031690,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1721,"user":{"displayName":"Minh-Thy Tyler","userId":"16823885628103027849"}},"outputId":"21752b51-3901-4e8f-ca43-334a93cc3db0"},"source":["#@title Similarity with BERT Embeddings: A Preview { display-mode: \"form\" }\n","#@title: Hover\n","import pandas as pd\n","import altair as alt\n","\n","url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/BERT-4-Humanists/main/data/bert-word-nature.csv\"\n","df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding='utf-8')\n","\n","search_keywords = ['nature', 'science', 'religion', 'art']\n","color_by = 'word'\n","\n","alt.Chart(df, title=f\"Word Similarity: {', '.join(search_keywords).title()}\").mark_circle(size=200).encode(\n","    alt.X('x',\n","        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)\n","    ), y=\"y\",\n","    color= color_by,\n","    href=\"link\",\n","    tooltip=['title', 'word', 'poem_title', 'author', 'period']\n","    ).interactive().properties(\n","    width=500,\n","    height=500\n",")"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","<div id=\"altair-viz-64ec8311d4f049139bb5a2307405e506\"></div>\n","<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","  var VEGA_DEBUG = (typeof VEGA_DEBUG == \"undefined\") ? {} : VEGA_DEBUG;\n","  (function(spec, embedOpt){\n","    let outputDiv = document.currentScript.previousElementSibling;\n","    if (outputDiv.id !== \"altair-viz-64ec8311d4f049139bb5a2307405e506\") {\n","      outputDiv = document.getElementById(\"altair-viz-64ec8311d4f049139bb5a2307405e506\");\n","    }\n","    const paths = {\n","      \"vega\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega@5?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lib\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lib?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lite\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lite@4.17.0?noext\",\n","      \"vega-embed\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-embed@6?noext\",\n","    };\n","\n","    function maybeLoadScript(lib, version) {\n","      var key = `${lib.replace(\"-\", \"\")}_version`;\n","      return (VEGA_DEBUG[key] == version) ?\n","        Promise.resolve(paths[lib]) :\n","        new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n","          var s = document.createElement('script');\n","          document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(s);\n","          s.async = true;\n","          s.onload = () => {\n","            VEGA_DEBUG[key] = version;\n","            return resolve(paths[lib]);\n","          };\n","          s.onerror = () => reject(`Error loading script: ${paths[lib]}`);\n","          s.src = paths[lib];\n","        });\n","    }\n","\n","    function showError(err) {\n","      outputDiv.innerHTML = `<div class=\"error\" style=\"color:red;\">${err}</div>`;\n","      throw err;\n","    }\n","\n","    function displayChart(vegaEmbed) {\n","      vegaEmbed(outputDiv, spec, embedOpt)\n","        .catch(err => showError(`Javascript Error: ${err.message}<br>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification.
