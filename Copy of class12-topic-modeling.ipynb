At its most basic level, topic modeling is an automated method for extracting the themes, or \"topics,\" from large sets of documents--like GPT-3 generated fiction, or Yelp reviews, or as we'll explore today, articles in the Emory Wheel."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O5yXIKaM4IIp"},"source":["There are numerous kinds of topic models, but the most popular and widely-used kind is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). It's so popular, in fact, that \"LDA\" and \"topic model\" are sometimes used interchangeably, even though LDA is only one type.\n","\n","LDA math is pretty complicated. We're not going to get very deep into the math just yet (or maybe not ever, depending on the time). But first we are going to introduce two important concepts that will help us conceptually understand how LDA topic models work."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mbWLFjuo4IIq"},"source":["### 1) LDA is an Unsupervised Algorithm \n","Topic modeling is a kind of machine learning. Machine learning always sounds complicated, but it really just means that computer algorithms are performing tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so and that they are \"learning\" how to perform these tasks by being fed training data. In the field of machine learning, algorithms are typically split into two broad categories: supervised and unsupervised. These categories describe how the algorithms are \"trained\" or how they \"learn.\" LDA is an unsupervised algorithm.\n","\n","If an algorithm is supervised, that means a researcher is helping to guide it with some kind of information, like labels. For example, if you wanted to create an algorithm that could identify pictures of cats vs pictures of dogs, you could train it with a bunch of pictures of cats that were clearly labeled CAT and a bunch of pictures of dogs that were clearly labeled DOG. The algorithm would then be able to learn which features are specific to cats vs dogs because you explicitly told it: this is a picture of a cat; this is a picture of a dog.\n","\n","If an algorithm is unsupervised, that means a researcher does not train it with outside information. There are no labels. The algorithm just learns that pictures of cats are more similar to each other and pictures of dogs are more similar to each other. The algorithm doesn't really know that one cluster is cats and one cluster is dogs; it just knows that there are two distinct clusters.\n","\n","Because LDA is an unsupervised algorithm, we don't tell our topic model which words or topics to look for. We only tell the topic model how many topics (or clusters of words) that we want returned. The topic model doesn't know anything about Frida Kahlo, Nella Larsen, and Jackie Robinson. It doesn't know anything about art, literature, and sports."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"urwfLeA24IIr"},"source":["### 2) LDA is a Probabilistic Model \n","LDA fundamentally relies on statistics and probabilities. Rather than calculating precise and unchanging metrics about a given corpus, as we've done thus far, a topic model makes a series of very sophisticated guesses about the corpus. These guesses will change slightly every time we run the topic model. This is important to remember as we analyze, interpret, and make arguments based on our results. All of our results in this lesson will be probabilities, and they'll change slightly every time we re-run the topic model.\n","\n","When we tell the topic model that we want to extract 15 topics from the Emory Wheel, here's what the topic model does:\n","\n","The topic model starts off with a slightly silly, backwards assumption. The topic model assumes that every single one of the 4000-some-odd articles in the corpus was written by someone who exclusively drew their words from 15 mystery topics, or 15 clusters of words. To spin it in a slightly different way with a different medium, the topic model assumes that there was one master artist with 15 different paints on her palette, who created all the articles by dipping her brush into these 15 paints alone, applying and blending them onto each canvas in different proportions. The topic model is trying to discover the 15 mystery topics that created all the Wheel articles, as well as the mixture of these topics that makes up each individual article.\n","\n","The topic model begins by taking a completely wild guess about the 15 topics, but then it iterates through all the words in all the article and makes better and better guesses. If the word \"student\" keeps showing up with the words \"stress\" and \"exam,\" and if all three words keep showing up in the same kinds of article, then the topic model starts to suspect that these three words should belong to the same topic. If the word \"film\" keeps showing up with \"Atlanta\" and \"industry,\" then the topic model suspects that they should belong to the same topic, too. The topic model finally arrives at its best guesses for the 15 topics that most likely created all the Emory Wheel articles.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KbzON5TC4IIs"},"source":["## LDA explained again in more abstract terms"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dOzLxfr24IIs"},"source":["Probabilistic topic models begin with an assumption and a definition. \n","\n","The assumption: all documents contain a mixture of different topics.\n","\n","The definition: a topic is a collection of words, each with a different probability of occurance in a particular document (or other chunk of text) discussing that topic. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yyKTRQOP4IIt"},"source":["Here's a nice illustration, created by Ted Underwood, that shows this assumed relatioship between topics and documents. \n","\n","![topics and docs](https://tedunderwood.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/shapeart.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PQ1pyg0F4IIu"},"source":["Above we see an example of the basic assumption of topic modeling: one topic might contain many occurrences of “organize,” “committee,” “direct,” and “lead.” Another might contain a lot of “mercury” and “arsenic,” with a few occurrences of “lead.” \n","\n","The three documents are assumed to contain both topics in different proportions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ComFUWe84IIv"},"source":["But here is the thing: we can’t directly observe topics.
