We're going to go over how one real-world API works, the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/). By introducing you to this API, you'll learn the tools necessary to sign up for, query, and interpret APIs from other providers (as you will be asked to do in your first quiz for this course).\n","\n","### Signing up for an API Key (aka Client Access Token)\n","\n","Before you can use the Genius API, you need to sign up for a \"client access token,\" which is another name for an API key, as was discussed in the homework. Do so by filling out the [New API Client form](https://genius.com/api-clients/new). If you don't yet have an account on Genius.com, you'll be prompted to register first. \n","\n","The next questions don't really apply to our use in class, but they're required to get your token. You'll be prompted to fill out a short form about the \"App\" that you need the Genius API for. You only need to fill out \"App Name\" and \"App Website URL.\" You can enter any words you want in \"App Name.\" Similarly, you can enter any URL in the \"App Website URL,\" like so:\n","\n","<img src=\"http://lklein.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-15-at-11.21.25-AM.png\" style=\"width:400px\">\n","\n","When you click \"Save,\" you'll be given a series of API keys: a \"Client ID\" and a \"Client Secret.\" To generate your \"Client Access Token,\" which is the API key that we'll be using in this notebook, you need to click \"Generate Access Token\".\n","\n","The token is just a string of letters and numbers. It'll look something like this:\n","\n","    6617c28c371f0a138f7912a35365564afe538605\n","    \n","That's your \"key\" for that API. Whenever you make a request to that API, you'll need to include your key in the request. The exact method for including the key will be explained below.

And a bit more on legal / ethical considerations, via Melanie Walsh\n","\n","### Legal considerations\n","\n","If internet data is publicly available (e.g., tweets from a public Twitter account), it is generally considered legal to collect this data, even if a particular platform says that you cannot. In 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that scraping publicly accessible websites likely does not violate federal anti-hacking laws. You can read more about [this legal ruling](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data#:~:text=Linkedin%20Protects%20Scraping%20of%20Public%20Data,-Share%20It%20Share&text=In%20a%20long%2Dawaited%20decision,and%20Abuse%20Act%20(CFAA)) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n","\n","### Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)\n","\n","Research that involves human participants (e.g., surveys, interviews, blood draws) needs to be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). But research about publicly available internet data does not typically require IRB approval.\n","\n","### Publishing, Privacy, and Citation \n","\n","Just because something is legal or gets approved by an IRB does not mean it is ethical. Collecting, sharing, and publishing internet data created by or about individuals can lead to unwanted public scrutiny, harm, and other negative consequences for those individuals. For these reasons, some researchers attempt to anonymize internet data before sharing it or before publishing an article that cites a post specifically. Yet anonymizing internet data also does not give credit to internet users as creators and authors.\n","\n","There is no single, simple answer to the many difficult questions raised by internet data collection. It is important to develop an ethical framework that responds to the specifics of your particular research project or use case (e.g., the platform, the people involved, the context, the potential consequences, etc.).\n","\n","In any published research, you may want to consider seeking explicit permission from internet users when you want to quote them in an article, or only share internet data that meets a certain threshold of publicness, such as tweets from verified Twitter accounts or Reddit posts with a certain number of upvotes. \n","\n","### Models & Examples of Social Media Data in Published Research\n","\n","Below are a few examples of how researchers have approached social media data in published research:\n","\n","### Paraphrasing Posts\n","In Maria Antoniak, David Mimno, and Karen Levy’s [article about a Reddit subcommunity dedicated to birthstories (r/BabyBumps)](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/resources/2019_cscw_birth_stories.pdf), which we will read later this semester, they paraphrased Reddit submissions discussed in the article and then deleted all collected Reddit data after the article was published.\n","\n","### Linking to Posts & Using “Reasonably Public” Thresholds\n","In Deen Freelon, Charlton McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark’s [report about the #BlackLivesMatter movement](https://cmsimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/beyond_the_hashtags_2016.pdf), they included links to tweets rather than the full text of tweets and only linked to tweets with a minimum of 100 retweets published by Twitter users who had at least 3,000 followers or were verified. They embargoed their Twitter data for a year and then publicly released a list of tweet IDs. Tweet IDs can be used by third-parties to re-download any tweets that have not been deleted yet.\n","\n","### Direct Collaboration & Conversation with Users\n","In Emory alum Moya Bailey’s [article about the #GirlsLikeUs hashtag](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000209/000209.html), created by trans advocate Janet Mock, she asked for Mock’s permission to work on the project before it began and collaborated with Mock to develop research questions and determine the project’s direction.\n","\n","## Additional Recommended Reading\n","\n","* [Doc Now White Paper](https://www.docnow.io/docs/docnow-whitepaper-2018.pdf), Bergis Jules, Ed Summers, Dr. Vernon Mitchell, Jr.\n","* [No Robots, Spiders, or Scrapers: Legal and Ethical Regulation of Data Collection Methods in Social Media Terms of Service](https://cmci.colorado.edu/~cafi5706/ICWSM2020_datascraping.pdf), Casey Fiesler, Nathan Beard, Brian C.
