To wit:\n","\n","<img src=\"http://lklein.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-06-at-3.33.34-PM.png\">\n","\n","Today, we're going to explore a method called Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf). Tf-idf comes up a lot in text analysis projects because it’s both a corpus exploration method and a pre-processing step for many other text-mining measures and models.\n","\n","The procedure was introduced in a 1972 paper by Karen Spärck Jones under the name “term specificity,” and the basic idea is this:\n","\n","Instead of representing a term in a document by its raw frequency or its relative frequency (the term count divided by the document length), each term is *weighted* by dividing the term frequency by the number of documents in the corpus containing the word. \n","\n","The overall effect of this weighting scheme is to avoid a common problem when conducting text analysis: the most frequently used words in any particular document are often the most frequently used words in all of the documents.\n","\n","By contrast, terms with the highest tf-idf scores are the terms in a document that are distinctively frequent in a document when that document is compared other documents. When you sort by tf-idf score, these distinctive terms rise to the top.

Since leaving campus takes a lot of effort (and also, crucially, access to a car), the food better be worth it! That means you'll need to balance two competing goals:\n","\n","1) The food has to be really tasty; and also, crucially: \n","2) If you're going to go all the way out to Buford Highway, it better be something that you can't also get in Emory Village. Otherwise, why go to all the trouble of getting there?!\n","\n","Or, to give an example involving actual food: you don't want to go all the way out to Buford Highway to get pizza. Even if the pizza on Buford Highway is pretty tasty, you can get pizza anywhere in town. How can you find out what is distintively tasty on Buford Highway?  \n","\n","If you looked up the Yelp reviews for the all restaurants on Buford highway and sorted by score, you would get an answer to the question of what's the tastiest. But it still won't help solve the problem of what's *distintively tasty* on Buford Highway--like hot pot, for example, which is something that you can't get in Emory Village.   \n","\n","So you need a way to tell the difference between what's tasty and what's distinctively tasty. To do so, you need to distinguish between four categories of food. Food that, on Buford Highway, is:\n","\n","- both tasty and distinctive (e.g. hot pot)\n","- tasty but not distinctive (e.g. pizza) \n","- distinctive but not tasty (e.g. tacos-- tho I'm open to disagreement here)\n","- neither tasty nor distinctive (e.g. Taco Bell--again, open to disagreement).\n","\n","These categories are what tf-idf helps you measure. Term frequencies can be assessed according to the same criteria. A term might be:\n","\n","- Frequently used in the corpus, and used especially frequently in one particular document <-- Interesting! \n","- Frequently used in the corpus, but used frequently in equal measure across all documents <-- Less interesting\n","- Infrequently used in the corpus, but nonetheless used frequently in one particular document <-- Potentially interesting\n","- Infrequently used in in the corpus and also infrequently used in the corpus consitently across all documents <-- Not interesting\n","\n","It's the words that are especially frequent in one document that are most interesting to us, and the ones that TF/IDF helps us identify. To see how, let's take a look at our next corpus--a slightly bigger one--articles published in the *Emory Wheel*."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ovRWSCyjFGPL"},"source":["## *The Emory Wheel* "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UAkuQmhJFGPM"},"source":["In this lesson, we're going to use tf-idf to study the articles published by *The Emory Wheel* betweeen 2014 and 2019.

2017-09-20-Fantastic-Bars-and-Where-to-Find-Them-Atlanta-s-Secret-Bars.txt\n","\n","You've been to Maggie's Neighborhood Bar and Grill — like, way too many times. Maybe you are ready to try something new. Or maybe you haven't been to Maggie's because it's \"too mainstream.\" Yourfavorite movie is \"Citizen Kane\" and you relish in the superiority of your unique, refined tastes. Or maybe you just love knowing something that other people don't, and your expertise in secrecy makes Varysfrom \"Game of Thrones\" look like an amateur. If any of these profiles sound familiar, secret bar-hoppingmay be for you. Atlanta is bursting with Prohibition-style bars just waiting to be explored. All you'll need to find them is a spirit for discovery (and an occasional password).Brigantine Beer Parlor: Resting cosily inside Argosy restaurant in the heart of East Atlanta, BrigantineBeer Parlor is the kind of bar that television shows like \"How I Met Your Mother\" try to recreate.Complete with skee ball, shuffleboard and pin ball machine tabletops, this hide away has more than enough to satisfy those looking for a chill time with friends. The wooden walls and tables give it anambience akin to a hip cabin, while the diverse beer list should satisfy even the snobbiest brewery-goerin your group (you know who they are). The DJ stuck primarily within the realm of classic and in die rocktunes, while decorations like a giant wooden squid and hundreds of skee ball trophies protect a quirkyvibe.To find it, head inside Argosy, then keep walking till you find yourself in the back of the restaurant and then into the beer parlor. The spot opens at 8 p.m., Wednesday through Saturday. Supposedly, if you repeatedly push a button on one of the skee ball machines, something special happens. Unfortunately,that's a secret I can't discuss any further.Red Phone Booth: For those aspiring to a true Prohibition-era experience, look no further. Red PhoneBooth oozes exclusivity, from the plushleather couches to a cocktail list that makes The Cheesecake Factory menu seem slim. Classic, RoyOrbison-style tunes play softly in the background while attendees wearing dresses and suits chatbetween sips from their martinis and puffs from their cigars.You'll need the password to make it beyond the booth. Maybe you know a friend who knows a friend whoknows; otherwise you can try asking around at another bar downtown. Password in hand, head inside the red phone booth and dial the number. The ph one side of the booth will swing inward, welcoming you to the 1920s.Pro tip: Suit up. Our first try, we didn't all have collared shirts. Getting turned away from a bar when you are under 21 is one thing; getting turned away when you are perfect legal age is another matter entirely.But, if you are like my friend who was \"glad they didn't let us in\" and couldn't wait to come back betterprepared, Red Phone Booth may be your cup of tea.El Bar: As far as secret bars go, El Bar couldn't be more different from Red Phone Booth. Dark, loud and definitely without a dress code, El Bar will more than satisfy those looking for a more traditional night out on the town. With a mix of tile, cinder block and textured rock walls, it succeeds in creating an underground vibe. Combined with the distinctly Mexican decor, ranging from pinatas to sugar skulls, itfeels a little bit like a year-round Dia de Los Muertos celebration. Floor space consumes the majority of the bar's relatively small area, clearly designed with dancing in mind. The DJ played a mix of recent hits,sticking mostly to current hip-hop trends. I specifically recall some Chance the Rapper and Khalid in themix.Located in Poncey-Highland, arrive after 10 p.m. and walk around to the back of El Ponce restaurant.Enter through the door at the building's corner. With margaritas and spiked Mexican soda on the menu,El Bar is a definite crowd-pleaser.Edgewood Speakeasy: Intuitively located amongst the bustle of Edgewood nightlife in Old Fourth Ward,this bar is only a short walk from Noni's. Akin to El Bar, the Edgewood Speakeasy provides a dark, lowlit atmosphere with both hip-hop and dance classics booming off the walls. Brick, tile and wooden walls give it an eclectic feel, while the open floor space in the middle of the room makes this a more than accommodating spot to unleash those dance moves you've been practicing back home. Our bartenderwas an all-around bro and helped us navigate the drink offerings on our first visit. Before we left wecouldn't resist the offer of $3 shots, the contents of which I know little more of than that they were\"watermelon.\"For those interested, walk inside Bone Lick BBQ, head toward the back of the restaurant and hang a slight left. Along the wall is a bookcase. Except it's not a bookcase, it's a door. Pull it open and revel in your Scooby-Doo-caliber detective skills.This list comprises just a few of the nearest secret bars (that I am aware of). For the true detectivesamong us, rest assured there is plenty more to uncover in Atlanta's speakeasy underworld. Just be sure to enjoy a drink now and then between investigations.\n"]}],"source":["# import this library for directory/file manipulation\n","import os\n","\n","# set the base directory -- note that this may need to change if you've saved a copy\n","# of this notebook elsewhere \n","base_dir = \"wheel-clean/\"\n","\n","# read in a list of all the filenames \n","docs = os.listdir(base_dir)\n","\n","# a list for storing the text of all the docs\n","wheel_docs = []\n","\n","# iterate through each of the docs in the directory\n","for doc in docs:\n","    with open(base_dir + doc, \"r\") as file:     # open the doc file \n","        text = file.read()                      # read the contents of the file \n","        wheel_docs.append(text)                   # append the contents of the file to our\n","                                                # all_docs list for future manipulation\n","\n","# just take a look at the first item to be sure it worked\n","print(\"Filename: \" + str(docs[0]) + \"\\n\") \n","print(wheel_docs[0])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RXRqmpZbFGPO"},"source":["## To the TF-IDF calculation... or not (yet)!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pl0Q4UiEFGPO"},"source":["Like many other methods, we can calculate tf-idf with just a few lines of code. But because the calculation relies on a process that is, in itself, a pre-processing step for many future methods, and is in itself a little heady, we're going to spend some time loooking under the hood.\n","\n","So without further ado, introduing.... the `CountVectorizer`!\n","\n","## But wait... the count what? \n","\n","Thus far, we've examined words in terms of their grammar and syntax. We've also looked at words in terms of various units: the word, the line, the document, etc. And we've counted the numbers of each of these. \n","\n","From here on out, however, we'll be taking a different approach. We'll be turning the words themselves into numbers, and then applying statistical measures and models to the numbers that represent the words. TF-IDF, as well as machine learning techniques including topic modeling, BERT, similarity, classification, and clustering--essentially, the set of methods we'll be learning in the second half of the course--all rely on this basic transformation.\n","\n","## Introducing scikit-learn! \n","\n","We've now reached another milestone--our first use of scikit-learn (often abbreviated as sk-learn), Python's major machine learning library, which also happens to be crucial to many of the more advanced methods named above. \n","\n","We're going to use this to transform our words into numbers.\n","\n","We'll begin by importing sk-learn's `CountVectorizer`, which [converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html). \n","\n","I think I've used the word \"token\" in passing before, but here I'll take a minute to formally define it, along with some related terms.\n","\n","## Tokens, features, document-term matrices\n","\n","According to the [Stanford NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html), a *token* is \"an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing.\" The unit of the token is usually the word, but it can also be the sentence, the subword, or anything else that makes sense for that particular task.\n","\n","Take this famous phrase, for example:\n","\n","\"To be or not to be\"\n","\n","This line has six tokens: \"to\", \"be\", \"or\", \"not\", \"to\", \"be\".\n","\n","It has four features: \"to\", \"be\", \"or\", \"not\"\n","\n","But wait, what is a feature?\n","\n","In this case, a *feature* is a unique token in the corpus. (Caveat: features, like tokens, can actually be anything that makes sense for the task, but for the purposes of turning words into numbers, features are most often unique words, or \"terms,\" as they're also sometimes called).\n","\n","When sk-learn's CountVectorizer does its thing, it first *tokenizes* all of the documents in the corpus--that is, it breaks up each document into its individual tokens--and then then creates a *document-term matrix* that counts up how many times each term, or feature, appears in each document. \n","\n","For example, the document-term matrix for the line above might look something like this:\n","\n","|   | to | be | or | not |\n","|---|----|----|----|-----|\n","|   | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1   |\n","\n","\n","If we add in the second part of that phrase as a new document, we might get something like this:\n","\n","\n","|         | to | be | or | not | that | is | the | question |\n","|---------|----|----|----|-----|------|----|-----|----------|\n","| line 1  | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1   | 0    | 0  | 0   | 0        |\n","| line 2  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0   | 1    | 1  | 0   | 0        |\n","\n","\n","But enough of vectorizing by hand;
